"""Instant per-note pipeline: runs the moment Meera drops a note into the
channel, rather than waiting for the twice-weekly batch.

Sequence: transcribe (if voice) -> clean/tag -> score the RAW note 0-10 ->
reject low scores -> if it passes, draft it (with a Google News hook) ->
send it back to Meera for review.

This scores the raw note, not a drafted post, deliberately - an earlier
version of this pipeline drafted first and scored the draft, and testing
caught a real failure mode: a good drafter can pad a thin note (e.g. "need
to restock boxes") into something that reads specific and polished, which
then fools a scorer looking at the polished prose rather than the
underlying material. Scoring the raw note first - the same order the
twice-weekly batch uses (app/batch.py, app/prompts/score.txt) - means a
note with nothing in it can't fake substance it doesn't have. This also
means only notes that pass ever cost a drafting call, instead of every note
costing one regardless of outcome.

Below REJECT_THRESHOLD (shared with app/batch.py): the note is auto-parked
with the score as its reason, and Meera gets a short message saying so (the
score and reason, not silence - an earlier version said nothing at all,
which just looked broken). Nothing is deleted - the note is still reachable
via "Show all" from any batch message, and gets re-scored on the next batch
or the next time material is added to it.

The twice-weekly batch (app/batch.py) still runs independently and will
re-score anything still sitting as 'new' or 'parked' - this instant path
doesn't replace it, it's a second entry point into the same scoring/draft
machinery.
